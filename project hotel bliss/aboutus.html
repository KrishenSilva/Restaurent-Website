					A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities
					provided inside a hotel room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to
					large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen
					facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, 
					lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, 
					higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business
					centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event
					facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function 
					services. Hotel rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow
					guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms.

                  The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For a period of about 200
				  years from the mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers.
				  Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern 
				  sense was opened in Exeter in 1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America
				  in the early 19th century, and luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

               Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality
			   companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale full-service hotel facility  offers luxury amenities, 
               full-service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the highest level of personalized service,
			   such as a concierge, room service, and clothes pressing staff. Full-service hotels often contain 
			   upscale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site full-service
			   restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities. Boutique hotels are smaller independent, non-branded
			   hotels that often contain upscale facilities.
